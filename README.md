# Kaleidoscope-Hardware-Dygma-Shortcut

This is a hardware plugin for [Dygma][dygma]'s [Shortcut][shortcut], for the v0.4 prototype in particular. There aren't many of these out there, I might be one of the few owners of one. Nevertheless, this is a reasonable sample how to port [Kaleidoscope][kaleidoscope] to a keyboard that uses the Atmega MCU.
